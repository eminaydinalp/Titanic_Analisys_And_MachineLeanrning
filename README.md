# Titanic_Analisys_And_MachineLeanrning
 I analyzed the Titanic dataset and edited outliers and missing values. And I still brought it ready for machine learning. I tried and analyzed Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression algorithms which are among the Machine Learning Algorithms. As a result, the best results of these algorithms are Decision Tree. and Random Forest.
